# check_links
Crawls links from a starting page and display the ones that go nowhere.

## Installation
You'll need to install [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/on_mac_osx_using_homebrew.html)

## Usage
Currently it's [hardcoded](https://github.com/feifanzhou/check_links/blob/master/src/check_links.cr#L34) to `https://docs.layer.com`. Change that if you need to point it to somewhere else.

Then `cd` and run `crystal src/check_links.cr`. You can also [compile an executable](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/using_the_compiler/index.html) if desired.
